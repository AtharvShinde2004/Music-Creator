## 📖 About
**Music Creator** is an interactive website designed to help users explore music production through code. The project was inspired by a performance on *India's Got Latent* hosted by Samay Raina, where a contestant used code to create music. This inspired me to learn more about how programming can be harnessed for music production, leading to the creation of this project.

With Music Creator, users can:
- Choose instruments and create custom beats.
- Adjust tempo and other musical elements.
- Visualize active beats with dynamic animations.

## 🎛 Features
- **Customizable Beat Grid**: 16-beat grid to create unique rhythm patterns.
- **Multiple Instrument Options**: Choose from Kick Drum, Snare Drum, Hi-Hat, and Synth sounds.
- **Dynamic Tempo Control**: Adjust the tempo to set the speed of your track.
- **Save and Load Beats**: Save custom beat patterns locally.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for desktops and mobile devices.
- **Visual Beat Animation**: Real-time beat highlighting enhances the user experience.

## 🎨 Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Structuring the app layout.
- **CSS**: Styling for an immersive dark theme with animated controls.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for sound generation, beat control, and user interactivity.
- **Web Audio API**: Sound synthesis for the instruments.
